## Task01. Declaring_and_calling_methods
### Task 1
* Develop a type that implements the Euclid algorithm for calculating the GCD of two integers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm).
* Add additional functionality to the developed type in the form of overloaded methods for calculating GCD for three, four, or five integers.
* Add to the developed type a method that implements the Stein algorithm (binary Euclid algorithm) for calculating the GCD of two integers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_GCD_algorithm). The method must accept an out parameter containing the value of the time spent for performing calculations.
* Change the method that implements the Euclid algorithm for calculating the GCD of two parameters, adding similar functionality.
* Add a method that prepares data for building a histogram that compares the time of finding a solution for each of the methods.
* Create unit tests to test the developed methods.
* All code should be annotated (autocommentary).
* The project must be hosted in the repository.

### Task 2
* Use OOP features: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
* When encoding, the code design conventions (C# code convention) must be used.
* Classes must be properly organized into libraries.
* Classes must have ToString(), GetHashCode (), and Equals () methods.
* Create a class that allows you to upload data from a text file into an array.
* Create classes to work with shapes defined on the plane.
* Shapes can be set by the size of their sides, or by the coordinates of their vertices.
* Provide methods for calculating the area and perimeter of each shape.
* Find all shapes equal to this one in the array.
* Create unit tests to test the developed methods.
* All code should be annotated (autocommentary).
* The project must be hosted in the repository.
